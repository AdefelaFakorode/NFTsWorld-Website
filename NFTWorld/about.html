        <p>What are NFTs? is one that continues to be asked by creatives around the world. Even as non-fungible tokens become more widely used and as the value of these tokens rise and fall, we continue to ask what is an NFT? Below I'll explain exactly what NFTs are, what NFTs are used for and how you can create NFT art. 
       
         What began as an experiment in new technology and then a way for artists to take ownership of their work and control their value, has now been joined by major brands and celebrities who have embraced NFTs. 
         
         The early adopters include Beeple – who set an NFT artwork auction record – as well as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, but now includes Nike, Disney and the world's most prominent galleries. NFTs can even be books, such as upcoming NFT Broadside. Game producer Square Enix has even sold off Tomb Raider to fund its NFT business. Former Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano has also announced his first NFT collection.
         
         Answering the question, 'what are NFTs?' is actually the easy part: non-fungible tokens are a way of registering a one-of-a-kind image, video, or any form of digital, or indeed, physical item on a blockchain. It's decentralised and open to scrutiny.

        <h3 class="mb-1 mt-5 text-center">Understanding Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h3> 
        <p>NFTs evolved from the ERC-721 standard. Developed by some of the same people responsible for the ERC-20 smart contract, ERC-721 defines the minimum interface—ownership details, security, and metadata—required for the exchange and distribution of gaming tokens. The ERC-1155 standard takes the concept further by reducing the transaction and storage costs required for NFTs and batching multiple types of non-fungible tokens into a single contract.
          1
          
          NFTs have the potential for several use cases. For example, they are an ideal vehicle to digitally represent physical assets like real estate and artwork. Because they are based on blockchains, NFTs can also work to remove intermediaries and connect artists with audiences or for identity management. NFTs can remove intermediaries, simplify transactions, and create new markets.
          
          Much of the current market for NFTs is centered around collectibles, such as digital artwork, sports cards, and rarities. Perhaps the most hyped space is NBA Top Shot, a place to collect non-fungible tokenized NBA moments in digital card form. Some of these cards have sold for millions of dollars.
          2
           Recently, Twitter's (TWTR) Jack Dorsey tweeted a link to a tokenized version of the first tweet ever, in which he wrote: "just setting up my twttr." The NFT version of the first-ever tweet sold for more than $2.9 million.
